## Ingredients: 
1 cup + 1 tablespoon unsalted butter  
1 cup sugar  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
2 cups all purpose flour  
1 teaspoon baking soda  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
2 tablespoons dry milk powder  
4 teaspoons matcha powder  
2 tablespoons milk  

## Procedure
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.
2. Cream together butter and sugar in a large bowl. Add vanilla extract and milk and beat well.
3. In another bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, salt, milk powder, and matcha powder. 
4. Mix flour mixture and creamed butter mixture and stir until well combined. If the dough is crumbly and dry, add additional milk 1-2 tablespoons at a time and mix to combine. If the dough is tacky, chill in refrigerator for 30 minutes. 
5. Lay parchment paper onto a baking sheet. Scoop out tablespoon of dough for each cookie, flatten slightly, and place 2 inches apart. 
6. Bake 10-12 minutes or until edges are slightly browned. 
7. Remove from oven and allow cookies to set on the pan for 5 minutes.
